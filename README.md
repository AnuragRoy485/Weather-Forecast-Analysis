## Description

This repository contains files related to a data analysis project. The aim of this project is to clean a dataset, perform some analysis on it, and generate insights. The main programming languages used in this project are Python and SQL. Power Bi is used as a visualization tool.


## Files in the Repository

The repository contains the following files:

**Cleaning-File.ipynb :** a Jupyter notebook file containing Python code for data cleaning and analysis.

**weather_dataset_stage1.xls :** an Excel file containing the raw data that needs to be cleaned.

**main_FIle.sql :** a SQL file containing queries for performing some additional analysis on the cleaned data.


## Installation

To run the Jupyter notebook, you need to have Python 3 and Jupyter installed on your computer. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
  pip install python
  pip install jupyter
```
To run the SQL queries, you need to have a database management system installed on your computer. You can use MySQL or PostgreSQL, for example.

## Usage
To run the Jupyter notebook, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the **Cleaning-File.ipynb** file is located, and run the following command:

```javascript
jupyter notebook data_cleaning.ipynb
```
This will open the notebook in your default web browser. You can then run each cell of code by clicking on it and pressing **Shift + Enter**.

To run the SQL queries, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the **main_FIle.sql** file is located, and run the following command:

```javascript
mysql -u username -p < main_FIle.sql
```
Replace **username** with your MySQL username. You will be prompted to enter your password.
